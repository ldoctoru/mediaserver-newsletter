### Requirements

- Docker 
- Jellyfin API key - [How to generate an API key](https://github.com/SeaweedbrainCY/jellyfin-newsletter?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-generate-a-jellyfin-api-key)
- A TMDB API key (free) - [How to generate a TMDB API key](https://github.com/SeaweedbrainCY/jellyfin-newsletter?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-generate-a-tmdb-api-key)
- A SMTP server 

### Configuration with built-in cron job
This is the default and recommended way to run the newsletter. The Docker container will run on a schedule using a built-in cron job. It will run on the schedule defined in the `config/config.yml` file.

1. Download the [docker-compose.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeaweedbrainCY/jellyfin-newsletter/refs/heads/main/docker-compose.yml) file:
```bash 
curl -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeaweedbrainCY/jellyfin-newsletter/refs/heads/main/docker-compose.yml
```

2. (optional) Edit the `docker-compose.yml` file to change the default user or timezone.

3. Create a `config` folder in the same directory as the `docker-compose.yml` file:
```bash
mkdir config
```

4. Download the [config file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeaweedbrainCY/jellyfin-newsletter/refs/heads/main/config/config-example.yml) in the `config` folder:
```
curl -o config/config.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeaweedbrainCY/jellyfin-newsletter/refs/heads/main/config/config-example.yml
```
5. Edit the `config/config.yml` file and fill in the required fields. **All fields are required.**
```yaml
scheduler:
    # Crontab expression to send the newsletter. 
    # Comment the scheduler section to disable the automatic sending of the newsletter. WARNING: IF COMMENTED, THE NEWSLETTER WILL BE RAN ONCE AT THE START OF THE CONTAINER.
    # Test your crontab expression here: https://crontab.guru/
    # This example will send the newsletter on the first day of every month at 8:00 AM
    cron: "0 8 1 * *"

```

> [!note]
> Note: It is recommended to use a static version instead of `latest`, and manually upgrade. [Last version](https://github.com/SeaweedbrainCY/jellyfin-newsletter/releases)


### Configuration with external cron job
Use this method if you want to run the script on a schedule using an external cron job or task scheduler, instead of the built-in cron job. Docker will run once, and exit after sending the newsletter.

1. Create a `config` folder.
```bash
mkdir config
```

2. Download the [config file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeaweedbrainCY/jellyfin-newsletter/refs/heads/main/config/config-example.yml) in the `config` folder:
```
curl -o config/config.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeaweedbrainCY/jellyfin-newsletter/refs/heads/main/config/config-example.yml
```
2. Edit the `config/config.yml` file and fill in the required fields. **All fields are required.**
```yaml
#scheduler:
    # Crontab expression to send the newsletter. 
    # Comment the scheduler section to disable the automatic sending of the newsletter. WARNING: IF COMMENTED, THE NEWSLETTER WILL BE RAN ONCE AT THE START OF THE CONTAINER.
    # Test your crontab expression here: https://crontab.guru/
    # This example will send the newsletter on the first day of every month at 8:00 AM
    #cron: "0 8 1 * *"

jellyfin:
    # URL of your jellyfin server
    url: "" 

    # API token of your jellyfin server, see requirements for more info
    api_token: ""

    # List of folders to watch for new movies 
    # You can find them in your Jellyfin Dashboard -> Libraries -> Select a library -> Folder **WITHOUT THE TRAILING /**
    watched_film_folders:
        - ""
        # example for /movies folder add "movies"


    # List of folders to watch for new shows
    # You can find them in your Jellyfin Dashboard -> Libraries -> Select a library -> Folder **WITHOUT THE TRAILING /**
    watched_tv_folders:
        - ""
        # example for /tv folder add "tv"
  
  # Number of days to look back for new items

tmdb:
    # TMDB API key, see requirements for more info
    api_key: ""

# Email template to use for the newsletter

# SMTP server configuration, TLS is required for now
# Check your email provider for more information

    smtp_username: ""
    # The password of your SMTP account
    smtp_password: ""

    smtp_sender_email: ""


# List of users to send the newsletter to
recipients:
  - ""
  # Example: "name@example.com" or to set username "Name <name@example.com>"
```

3. Run the docker container to send the newsletter
```bash
docker run --rm \
    -v ./config:/app/config \
    ghcr.io/seaweedbraincy/jellyfin-newsletter:v0.6.0
```
> [!note]
> Note: It is recommended to use a static version instead of `latest`, and manually upgrade. [Last version](https://github.com/SeaweedbrainCY/jellyfin-newsletter/releases)

4. Schedule the script to run on a regular basis. 
```bash
# Unix :
crontab -e
# Add the following line to run the script every 1st of the month at 8am
0 8 1 * * root docker run --rm -v PATH_TO_CONFIG_FOLDER/config:/app/config/ ghcr.io/seaweedbraincy/jellyfin-newsletter:v0.6.0
```
